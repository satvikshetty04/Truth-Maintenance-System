A truth maintenance system, or TMS, is a knowledge representation method for representing both beliefs and their dependencies and an algorithm called the "truth maintenance algorithm" that manipulates and maintains the dependencies. The name truth maintenance is due to the ability of these systems to restore consistency.

The input of the TMS is a text ﬁle containing a sequence of actions that will force the TMS to add and retract multiple items. The system should print out the ﬁnal status of the TMS knowledge base after executing the actions in the input ﬁle.
